	Title: Held Hostage..
	Content:  Some of your soldiers have been held hostage by Iran Military. To set them free, you need access to their database. The database is distributed amongst 21 servers. It is known that each server has the same password. However, you've already attempted access to 20/21 servers and been blocked. This is your last chance! Following information has been gathered from the previous attacks:

Q3. Function: iran_solo_inv()
	Points: 300
	Title: Plane Hijack
	Content: You have decided to enter Iran in stealth mode. Crack password to their base. Following information about the current code has been leaked by an insider. See if you can crack it:
	The password is last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10<n<10^17, having property as depicted:

	Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit 7 to the front of it, giving us 714285.
	It can be verified that 714285 = 5 * 142857. This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.

Q4. Function: iran_solo_redwed()
	Points: 200
    Title: Convince The Supplier
    Content: The supplier doesn't trust anyone without a code!! You are new and have been entrusted with the task of arranging ammunition. Enter the code below. Follow the gudelined below to get the code:

    Consider the triangle below:
     1
    |2| |3|
     4  |5|  6
    |7 | 8   9   10
    |11| 12 |13| 14 15
    ...

    A set of three primes is called a prime triplet if one of the three primes has the other two as neighbours in the triangle. (Neighbors refers to top, below, left, right and diagonal ones, MAX 8).
    (|n| is a prime triplet member)
    We define S(n) as the sum of the primes in row n which are elements of any prime triplet.
    For example, S(5) = 24 and S(2) = 5.

    Key = S(10000)

Q5. Function: iran_red_succ()
	Points: 150
    Title: Formation
    Content: Fighting off their deffences will need a certain formation for the army. This formation has been scribbled on a document present inside a safe. Access the document and fight off their deffences!!. Enter the safe code below.

    Safe Code: Sum of all n, 0 <= n <= 100, such that f(n) is a perfect square modulo 10^9 + 7.
    Here, f(n) is the sum of the squares of the digits (in base 10) of n, ex:
    f(442) = 4^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 = 36

    Ans: 826

Q6. Function: iran_stealth()
	Points: 50
	Title: Hide the files!!
	Content: Out of the 1000 files of evidence, one proves your involvement. However, the labor
            available at hand is unskilled and incapable of reading. The evidence file has a special 
            property, it leave an impression on the hands of whoever touched it, which turns blue within
            10 to 20 hours of contact. The impression is however, otherwise undetectable. What is the 
            minimum amount of labor you will require to find the file within 24hrs ?
	Ans: 10

Q7. Function: 
	Points: 800
	Title: Secure their Network
	Content: Make them accept your explanation, by helping them with the Following problem:
	To cut costs, UN wished to power their network with their own special encryption. Each server would further 
	encrypt and send information to the server numbered next, with the top server sending data back down 
    to the bottom server. That way, they could have the information entered on any node and have data flow 
    freely throughout the network.

    Unfortunately, the designers misinterpreted the schematics when they built the network. It was leaked that 
    each server sends data to another server at random, instead. 
    This may compromise their freedom to have the data entering the network anywhere, since certain nodes may 
    never recieve the info and hence increase data loss risks.

    For example, consider the following connections in a 3 server based network with servers numbered 1,2 and 3 
    in order:
    1 connects to 3
    3 connects to 2
    and 2 connects to 3

    If the information was fed in the first node, then every server would receive data. But if it were fed in the 
    second or third servers instead, then there would be no data entering first server. Note that while a given 
    server can receive data from many other servers at once, it can only send data to one other server.

    To resolve the data loss risks, UN decided to have a minimal number of servers rewired. To rewire a server is 
    to change the server it sends data to. In the sample above, all possible losses can be avoided by rewiring 
    the second server to send data to the first server instead of the third server.

    Let F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of server rewirings needed over all possible data-flow arrangements
    in a network of n servers. For example, F(3) mod 135707531 = 6.
    Find F(8) mod 135707531.

	Ans: 16276736

Q8. Function:UN_Moderate
	Points:
	Title:Trusty Old Farts
	Content:Your explanation was rejected, it's now time to send in your time-tested lawyers

	You have nine lawyers with, whose arguments can have an effectiveness of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
	Iran has only six lawyers but their arguments can have effectiveness from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 due to your aggression.

	Find out the probability of your lawyers succeeding to help them plan better, if the efficacy of both sides' arguments are equal, it's a draw.
	Submit your answer upto 7 decimal places, as 0.BCDEFGH

	Ans: 0.5731441

Q10. Guerilla Warfare
	Points:
	Title:To hell with Reason!
	Content:You refuse to engage Iran on the cyber front, sling your greatsword on your back, and walk out of the white house, prepared for guerilla warfare.

	The Iranian are also well-versed with guerrilla warfare and seem to be implying a strategy relying on gozinta chains, solve this problem to defeat them on their own land.
	
	A gozinta chain for n is a sequence {1,a,b,...,n} where each element properly divides the next.
	There are eight gozinta chains for 12:
	{1,12} ,{1,2,12}, {1,2,4,12}, {1,2,6,12}, {1,3,12}, {1,3,6,12}, {1,4,12} and {1,6,12}.
	Let g(n) be the number of gozinta chains for n, so g(12)=8.
	g(48)=48 and g(120)=132.

	Find the sum of the numbers n not exceeding 1016 for which g(n)=n.

Q12. Throne Room
	Points:
	Title: Victor's Choice
	Content: The final push, you attempt to capture the royal palace.

	The path to the throne room is blocked by a door, you must get the passcode in time or the king may flee.
	The passcode is the 3 X 10^6th term of a series defined by: 
		a0 = 1;
		for n â‰¥ 1, an is the sum of the digits of all preceding terms.
	The 10^6th term is 31054319
	The sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 23, 28, 38, 49, ...
