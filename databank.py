Q3. Function: iran_solo_inv()
	Points: 300
	Title: Plane Hijack
	Content: You have decided to enter Iran in stealth mode. Crack password to their base. Following information about the current code has been leaked by an insider. See if you can crack it:
	The password is last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10<n<10^17, having property as depicted:

	Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit 7 to the front of it, giving us 714285.
	It can be verified that 714285 = 5 * 142857. This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.

Q7. Function: 
	Points: 800
	Title: Secure their Network
	Content: Make them accept your explanation, by helping them with the Following problem:
	To cut costs, UN wished to power their network with their own special encryption. Each server would further 
	encrypt and send information to the server numbered next, with the top server sending data back down 
    to the bottom server. That way, they could have the information entered on any node and have data flow 
    freely throughout the network.

    Unfortunately, the designers misinterpreted the schematics when they built the network. It was leaked that 
    each server sends data to another server at random, instead. 
    This may compromise their freedom to have the data entering the network anywhere, since certain nodes may 
    never recieve the info and hence increase data loss risks.

    For example, consider the following connections in a 3 server based network with servers numbered 1,2 and 3 
    in order:
    1 connects to 3
    3 connects to 2
    and 2 connects to 3

    If the information was fed in the first node, then every server would receive data. But if it were fed in the 
    second or third servers instead, then there would be no data entering first server. Note that while a given 
    server can receive data from many other servers at once, it can only send data to one other server.

    To resolve the data loss risks, UN decided to have a minimal number of servers rewired. To rewire a server is 
    to change the server it sends data to. In the sample above, all possible losses can be avoided by rewiring 
    the second server to send data to the first server instead of the third server.

    Let F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of server rewirings needed over all possible data-flow arrangements
    in a network of n servers. For example, F(3) mod 135707531 = 6.
    Find F(8) mod 135707531.

	Ans: 16276736

Q9. Function: Iran_Cyber
	Points:
	Title:Iran Cyber Attack
	Content: Iran has launched an attack on your digital foundations, find the passcode to prevent a complete strategic defeat.
	125874, and its double, 251748, have the same digits, similarly, the passcode is the smallest positive integer x such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x and 6x contain the same digits.
	Ans: 142857

Q10.Function: Guerilla Warfare
	Points:
	Title:To hell with Reason!
	Content:You refuse to engage Iran on the cyber front, sling your greatsword on your back, and walk out of the white house, prepared for guerilla warfare.

	Iranian Strongholds are arrayed in the form of Pascal's Triangle, with 51 rows, with the vulnerable holdings being those whose number in
	the triangle is square-free, i.e., not divisible by the square of any prime.
	Find the sum of the distinct square free numbers in these 51 rows.
	Ans: 34029210557338

Q11.Function: Intelligence Service
	Points:
	Title:Fight Wire with Wire
	Content:You summon that peculiar mixture of young and old, pale as if they haven't seen the sun in decades, our Intelligence Service!
	To break the Iranian assault, you must navigate the halls of circular thinking and break free.
	Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

	37 36 35 34 33 32 31
	38 17 16 15 14 13 30
	39 18  5  4  3 12 29
	40 19  6  1  2 11 28
	41 20  7  8  9 10 27
	42 21 22 23 24 25 26
	43 44 45 46 47 48 49

	It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.

	If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

	Ans: 26241


Q12. Throne Room
	Points:
	Title: Victor's Choice
	Content: The final push, you attempt to capture the royal palace.

	The path to the throne room is blocked by a door, you must get the passcode in time or the king may flee.
	The passcode is the 3 X 10^6th term of a series defined by: 
		a0 = 1;
		for n ≥ 1, an is the sum of the digits of all preceding terms.
	The 10^6th term is 31054319
	The sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 23, 28, 38, 49, ...

	Ans:102915032

Q13. Func: Iran Network Down
	Points:
	Title:War of the wizards
	Content:You try to bring the iranian network down, paving the way for a complete strategic victory.
	Their binary nature of their network intertwines it's fate with the number 2, you must get to understand the root of 2 to destroy it.
	The square root of 2 can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction. sqrt(2) =  1 + (1 / (2 + 1 / (2 + 1 / (2 + 1.....
	Expanding this for the first three iterations:
	1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
	1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
	1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 17/12 = 1.4166...
	The eighth expansions is 1393/985, which is the first exxpansion where the number of digits in the numerator is mroe than that in the denominator.
	In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?

	Ans: 153

Q14. Func: Ashen Victory
	Points:
	Title: Forward, glorious death!
	Content:You believe in our troops and give them the chance to savour the ashen taste of victory.
	In the midst of battle, divine inspiration strike you and you realise that the secret to overflowing the enemy encirclements is held in Budget-Lychrel numbers.
	If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
	Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,

	349 + 943 = 1292,
	1292 + 2921 = 4213
	4213 + 3124 = 7337

	That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
	It has long been thought by sages that some numbers never arrive at a palindrome, 50 is a big number, numbers that do not fall in line(become a palindrome) in 50
	iterations are to be deemed Budget-Lychrel numbers and are the secret to victory.
	How many Lychrel Numbers are there below ten-thousand.

	Ans: 249
